I initially misunderstood this problem, I thought I could solve it by ordering
the user's entry into ascending and descending order (into to separate
variables) and then simply print all the numbers in between, but that of course
included numbers that were not available.

The correct solution involved learning about the permutations method:

It finds out all the different combinations of the numbers and then I printed
it to a list which I was able to iterate through and print for each possible
combination. I was able to check the answer was correct by counting the number
of combinations which should be 4! = 24.
