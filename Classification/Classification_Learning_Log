For a short program, this is a very powerful. I was introduced to the
scikit-learn library, it is an open source set of machine learning libraries
for Python, and is also used for statistical modelling.

I chose to use this library in oppose to using a combination of if statements
to create a more efficient code and one that expanded my skillset. To get this
code to work as intended, I also read up on the enumerate method


Learning about enumerate: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/enumerate
The purpose of the enumerate method is to The enumerate() method adds counter
to an iterable and returns it. The returned object is a enumerate object.

Learning about predict_probab: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40770638/sklearn-predict-multiple-outputs
I was going to use the predict_probab rather than .predict method because some
of the programming languages have the same features and I wanted the program to
share all three with the user. However, I found that it was challenging to
accomodate for one result as well as multiple results (when one worked, the
other didn't). I will come back to this as I learn more about machine learning.

Learned more about decision trees in Python here: https://towardsdatascience.com/scikit-learn-decision-trees-explained-803f3812290d
I also read up about decisioin tree in Python to facilaite machine learning, I
think what happens is the features are normalised and then a threshold is set
to say the machine has worked out the target value. I think there's more to
this but I will come back to the problem as I think I've jumped a few steps as
well in this area.
